restructure: 

- create ssh vault
- setup-local (needs ssh vault pw, creates local priv key for ansible user)
- create remote user (provide secrets vault pw)
- setup remote (needs secrets vault pw)

ssh vault: local
secrets vault: servers


is it possible to remove ssh login for ansible user alone?

- install nginx, db, wordpress etc...
