- docker postgresql is installed, but security needs attention, with pg_hba module, ssl with internal certificate?
- force ssl to db
- add postgres user to ldap
- create info file for database like I did for ldap (for othewr containerts to connect to)

- docker nginx on internal machine with internal certificate
- docker nginx on external machine with LetsEncrypt certifcate
- docker wordpress install
